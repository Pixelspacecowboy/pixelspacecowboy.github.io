    <h1><i class="fas fa-user-check"></i> Professional Self-Assessment</h1>

    <p>
      Transitioning from the Navy to software engineering has been a journey shaped by resilience, discipline, and adaptability. My experiences as an Electrical Plant Operator gave me a strong foundation in systems thinkingâ€”skills I now use in software design, troubleshooting, and automation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the course of the Computer Science program, Iâ€™ve developed collaborative coding habits through GitHub, improved technical communication for both technical and non-technical audiences, and grown confident in using data structures and secure coding practices in Python, C++, and SQL.
    </p>

    <p>
      Iâ€™m especially passionate about the cybersecurity field, with long-term goals to pursue roles in DevSecOps or as a security-focused software engineer. I thrive in environments where I can build systems that are both robust and resilientâ€”just like the ones I worked on while serving.
    </p>

    <p>
      This self-assessment reflects both my professional evolution and my commitment to building software that serves real-world needs with reliability and purpose.
