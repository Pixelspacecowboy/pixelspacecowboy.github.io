    <h2>🔰 Introduction: The Journey That Built Me</h2>
    <p>This degree signifies not merely the completion of a series of courses; it embodies a narrative of resilience and restoration.</p>
    <p>After my tenure with the U.S. Navy as an Electrician’s Mate, I experienced a career-defining workplace incident that irrevocably altered my life. Electrocuted by high-voltage starting current during my deployment overseas, I suffered a shattered hip, compromised health, and an uncertain future. At the age of 29, I was medically retired, compelled to withdraw from all that I had known, including the sense of purpose and discipline that characterized my life.</p>
    <p>I could have succumbed to despair; however, I chose a different path. Instead, I rebuilt my life from the ground up—this Computer Science degree serving as the foundation. It honed my problem-solving capabilities, reignited my passion for tech, and equipped me with tools to forge a new career path driven by logic, code, and cybersecurity awareness.</p>
    <p>This portfolio is a testament to that transformation—highlighting my adaptability, technical growth, and unrelenting drive for knowledge.</p>

    <h2>⚙️ Strengths and Long-Term Goals</h2>
    <p>My greatest asset is <strong>systems thinking</strong>—forged in nuclear engineering, sharpened through software. I excel where software meets hardware, particularly in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Embedded systems development</li>
      <li>IoT device programming</li>
      <li>Industrial automation</li>
      <li>Cybersecurity for control systems</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Long term, I aim to work at the intersection of <strong>cybersecurity and automation</strong>, protecting critical infrastructure and mentoring fellow veterans transitioning into tech.</p>

    <h2>💡 Skills Developed Throughout the Program</h2>

    <h3 class="emoji-title">🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Collaboration in Technical Environments</h3>
    <p>Group projects, code reviews, and Agile workflows allowed me to bring real-world leadership from the Navy into my software education. I used Git, GitHub Projects, and markdown to collaborate asynchronously—skills I apply daily in freelance and real-world development settings.</p>

    <h3 class="emoji-title">📢 Technical Communication: Visual, Written, and Oral</h3>
    <p>I’ve created UML diagrams, narrated screencasts, and developer documentation. I learned to translate complex systems into understandable formats—such as JWT authentication or FSM-based temperature controllers—tailored for all audiences.</p>

    <h3 class="emoji-title">📐 Algorithms and Data Structures</h3>
    <p>Rebuilding my Student Score Sorter taught me performance-focused design—using merge sort and binary search while explaining trade-offs and benchmarking results. This sharpened my approach to scalable solutions in both Python and C++.</p>

    <h3 class="emoji-title">🔧 Software Engineering and Embedded Systems</h3>
    <p>My proudest artifact is the Raspberry Pi Thermostat Controller. It evolved from a basic LED toggle to a multithreaded, sensor-integrated FSM system with LCD feedback and GPIO input. I built it to withstand failures like reboots and sensor loss—blending my hardware background with modern software practices.</p>

    <h3 class="emoji-title">🗃️ Databases and Persistent Storage</h3>
    <p>My Book Tracker app was enhanced with SQL injection protection, input validation, and CLI CRUD functionality—shifting my mindset toward data integrity and backend responsibility. I’ve since explored MongoDB and RESTful API design.</p>

    <h3 class="emoji-title">🔐 Security Mindset and Threat Awareness</h3>
    <p>Courses in secure coding and reverse engineering taught me to think like an attacker. I now default to boundary validation, least-privilege access, clear error handling, and static analysis in all development practices.</p>

    <h2>🎯 Closing Reflection</h2>
    <p>This degree taught me far more than just how to code—it taught me how to think, lead, and problem-solve with precision and purpose.</p>
    <p>I’m proud of this ePortfolio. It’s more than a collection of projects—it’s proof that I’ve grown, that I can solve meaningful problems, and that I’m ready for what comes next.</p>
    <p>And when my daughter asks, “How did you rebuild your life, Dad?”—I’ll show her this portfolio and say:</p>
